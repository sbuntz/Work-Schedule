## Purpose
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of their workday. 
The hour blocks will change colour for those in the past, present and future to allow the user to know exactly what is to be done, what has been done and what they are currently meant to be doing.
The application will also freeze all activities from the previous hours to ensure nothing is altered and the current daily schedule remains relevant and up to date.
